a) Can you use MPEG 7 for analog media? Why (not)?
Yes since the MPEG7 Standard is completely detached from the standard an format of the content it describes.
It would be possible to just print the MPEG7 XMLs an ship them with e.g. an analogue photo.

b) Which has better compression: MPEG 4 or MPEG 7?
Since MPEG7 is no comppression standard the comparison is more or less meaningless...
Or you could say that content in MPEG4 has a better compression since MPEG7 isn't bound to compression.
Of course it's possible to minify XMLs but that doesn't account for much...

c) What are potential reasons why we do not encounter MPEG 7 more often
 (e.g. for media search)?
Storing and maintaining XMLs is to much effort and uses to many resources.
Serving XMLs as meta-data needs client side efforts to parse and process.
Probably most media doesn't have MPEG-7 XMLs attached to them since it takes
a lot of resources to produce them.
