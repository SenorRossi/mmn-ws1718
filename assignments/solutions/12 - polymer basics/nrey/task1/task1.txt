a) What are the reasons for which YouTube made the switch to HTML5?
- now supports ABR which is essential to QoE of YouTube
- native to modern browsers and no need to use 3rd party plugins
- less and less support by Adobe itself

b) Why does Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) reduce buffering?
- mechanism detects the download rate for a client and sends data packets in higher/lesser quality depending 
on if the bitrate of the content is more/less than the download rate => content can be displayed faster because the time to
wait until data packets arrive is reduced

c) Why is reducing buffering desirable
- higher QoE
- more immersive if content is displayed smoothly without need to wait
- less and less users are willing to wait for content to download if it takes to long

d) What does “heavily congested networks” mean?
- high data traffic
- throughput limits of network are reached
- a lot of clients are using the network at the same time
=> e.g. 3G/4G mobile networks

e) What does this article have to do with DASH?
- DASH is a standard that sends data streams as packets over HTTP and implements ABR
