RAIL Model

Describes the aspects of an apps lifecycle, Response, Animation, Idle, Load, and how performance and user experience fits into them.
A guideline that describes user behavior concerning delays while interacting or loading an app and the timeframe to implement tasks
so as not to compromise QoE.

PRPL

Describes a pattern of how to build und bundle resources for an app to meet optimum performance criteria when loading pages.
It addresses the problem on how resources are loaded and cached.

Progressive Web App (PWA)

Traditional web sites that might appear to the client like a native or mobile application and aim to combine web pages with the 
benefits of mobile apps concerning resource bundling and caching.
A concept that tries to mimic the performance of native apps and make the development and maintainence of web apps more efficient.

Critical Rendering Path
The steps that a browser must execute to render a page, i.e. requesting resources, parsing resources, building DOM, CSSDOM
and applying javascript.
The CRP addresses the problem on how resources should be served to provide for a minimum time to render critical content in a 
client browser and how the resources are dependend upon each other.


AMPs

Pages that are built on a derived format of HTML that includes restrictions on how external resources can be used and loaded
and on how render/parser blocking resources are handled. The again address the topic on how to build web pages based on optimum
performance issues.

App Shell

The minimum required CSS, HTML and JS that is needed to reliably and instantly load an app on a users screen. The minimum resources
are built to be cached on don't contain dynamic content that needs to be loaded from a server every time => better QoE
